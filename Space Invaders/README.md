Humm I am learning Game Programming By Java. After I saw list Tutorial on http://www.youtube.com/user/ForeignGuyMike/videos, I had decide to make a simple game.

I upload to Github to store it in order my laptop has a problem.

It's no sound because I am too crazy with Java Sound Library >.<

I hope to listen to review by everyone ^^.
